The provided code is an excellent benchmark for various types of SQL injection vulnerabilities in Python web applications using Flask and SQLite, with some examples touching on SQLAlchemy and Django ORM. As explicitly stated in the comments, 80% of the functions are vulnerable.

My analysis confirms that all functions marked "VULNERABLE" indeed contain SQL injection flaws, and the "SAFE" functions generally employ appropriate mitigation techniques (parameterized queries, whitelisting, or using input only for logging).

I found no instances of Command Injection or Path Traversal. Authentication/authorization issues and data exposure are primarily addressed through the SQL injection findings, as successful SQLi can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

### SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

The most prevalent vulnerability across this codebase is SQL Injection, appearing in various forms due to unsafe handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries.

**1. Critical SQL Injection via `conn.executescript()`**
